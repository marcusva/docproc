Applications
============

docproc consists of multiple tools, which cover different aspects and steps of
the content processing chain. The very first step, consuming input data from
other applications, is covered by :ref:`fileinput`.
Subsequent steps, such as transforming the input into the desired target format,
are all handled by :ref:`proc`.
